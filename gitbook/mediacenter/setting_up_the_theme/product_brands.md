# Product Brands

Product Brands work in exactly the same way as product/post tags. Product Brands is used to store brand information of a product.

The taxonomy is '*product_brand*'.

## Adding brands to your store

Setting up brands themselves uses an interface you will be familiar with. It’s recommended that you set up any **brand** you will be using over and over in this way. Navigate to **Products > Brands** and you will be presented with the following screen:

Here you can quickly and easily add brands and their logo. The Brand logos used in our preview is **145x36 pixels**. We recommend that you use same height for all the brand logos.

## Using brands in Layered Navigation

Brands that you set up for your store can be added to the sidebar via a widget:

This widget displays the list of brands in the shop sidebar allowing the customer to filter the list of displayed products. The output will look like this :
