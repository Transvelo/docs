# Adding Products

Now for the fun stuff, adding your products! But before diving into your first product you should familiarise yourself with how product categories, tags and attributes work. Read in detail about [managing products](http://docs.woothemes.com/document/managing-products/).

## Additional Product Information

In addition to the product information that can be added to a product, **Pizzaro** allows you to add an important information to your product which is '*Product Attributes*'. Read more details about product attributes in [**Product Attributes**](product_attributes.md)
