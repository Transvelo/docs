# General Setup

## Setting the Home Page

By default, Wordpress displays blog posts in the home page but we will display a static page as our home page.
1. For that we'll have to create a page and call it **Home v1**.
2. Create another Page from **Pages > Add New ** and name it **Blog**.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Reading ** and choose **A static page** radio button option for **Front page displays** settings.

We'll create the contents of the Blog and Home page later.
