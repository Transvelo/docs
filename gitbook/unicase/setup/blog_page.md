# Blog Page

By default Wordpress displays blog posts in front page but Unicase theme uses a static page as its front page. So we'll have to create a new page called **Blog** and will use it to display the blog posts.

## Setting the Blog Page

1. Navigate to **Pages > Add New**.
2. Enter the title **Blog** and click on **Publish**.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Reading**.
4. Click on **A static Page** option for **Front page displays**.
5. In the **Posts page** dropdown, choose the page you just created in step 2.

### Choosing a Blog Page Layout

Unicase allows you to display your Blog posts in 3 different layouts.

1. **Sidebar Right** - This is the default layout. The Blog page will have 2 columns divided roughly into 75% and 25%. The 75% of the screen is the main content and it displays the blog posts. The 25% screen of the screen is the sidebar and it displays widgets. As the name suggests, the sidebar will be to the right side of the screen.
2. **Sidebar Left** - Same as **Sidebar Right** except that the **Sidebar** appears to the left of the screen.
3. **Full-width** - This layout does not display any sidebars. The Full-width layout can have be **widely dense** which means the content section occupies from left to right ends or **narrowly dense** which means the content section will be only 75% wide as in sidebar layouts but aligned centered.

You can select blog page layout form **Unicase > Blog Tab > Blog Page Layout**.

### Animating Post Items

1. BounceIn

5. RotateIn
6. RoleIn
7. ZoomIn

You can set whether you want to animate the product item from **Unicase > Blog Tab > Post Item Animation **.

### Sharing Post

Enable/Disable share post  from **Unicase > Blog Tab > Single Post Share Block **.

## Blog Post

## Sidebar

If a sidebar layout is chosen, then the sidebar is populated with widgets. The name of the sidebar area is **Sidebar**.
