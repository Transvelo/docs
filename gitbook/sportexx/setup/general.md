# General Setup

## Setting the Home Page

By default, Wordpress displays blog posts in the home page but we will display a static page as our homage page.
1. For that we'll have to create a page and call it home.
2. Create another Page from **Pages > Add New ** and name it **Blog**.
3. Navigate to **Settings > Reading ** and choose **A static page** radio button option for **Front page displays** settings.

We'll create the contents of the Blog and Home page later.

## Other General Setup

1. [**Logo and Favicon**](logo_and_favicon.md)
2. [**Header**](header.md)
3. [**Footer**](footer.md)
